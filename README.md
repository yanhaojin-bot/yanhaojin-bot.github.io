## Current status -- Jul. 5, 2022
I am happy to get a recommendation from  Google's Hiring Committee. Cheers!

Right now, I am in Google's team match phase and would like to join in a engineering team this August or September as a L3 Engineer.

 My public profile shows that the internship projects which I participated in at Microsoft and TikTok and several courses I took at the university equipped me with hands-on experience in cloud computing, mobile and full-stack development.

 I am physically living in California and I am willing to make a move for the right oppotunity at the states. 

 Please let me know if there is any other information I can provide!
